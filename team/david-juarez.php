        <p class="text">
			  David Juarez is Invent2Vision's Web and Graphic Designer. He graduated from Mt Sierra College with a Bachelor’s degree in Media Arts & Graphic Design. After graduation, he continued to spread his creativity and design skills in the web world as a web designer. He enjoys the challenges that comes with the design and development of modern responsive web applications. He also loves the fact that since technology is always improving, there is always something new to learn.
			  <br><br>
  			Most of all, David enjoys the fact that he gets the opportunity to help design and redesign something new from scratch. Being able to create a web application that enables brands to reach out to their customer’s needs and seeing the reaction on their face when they see the final result is one of the best feeling to him.
			  <br><br>
  			If you see him pondering back and forth, or with an earphone on one ear sitting in front of a computer screen, it is most likely that he is on the verge of resolving a bug from his code! When David is not at the desk working on a project, you are most likely to find him sketching on a sketchbook, practicing his coding and programming skills by watching tutorials and building personal projects, or spending time with loved ones.
